Therefore, the NC relation must not be Agree. agree, upward, downward, direction, directionality, negation, concord, italian, french, west flemish, interaction, satisfaction, agree, syntax\",\n          \"Agree as derivational operation: Its definition and discontents Using the framework laid out by Collins and Stabler (2016), I develop a formal definition of Agree as a syntactic operation. I begin by constructing a formal definition of a version of long-distance Agree in which a structurally higher element values a feature on a structurally lower element, and modify that definition to reflect various versions of Agree that have been proposed in the \\u201cminimalist\\u201d literature. I then discuss the theoretical implications of these formal definitions, arguing that Agree requires a new conception of the lexicon, and unjustifiably violates NTC in all its non-vacuous forms. theory, formalization, minimalism, agree, derivations, syntax\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Popularity_Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0022721123855445552,\n        \"min\": 0.0032148104613576255,\n        \"max\": 0.009356450191007934,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.006870408463120776,\n          0.007317073170731708,\n          0.009356450191007934\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Recency_Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.044721359549995794,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
